Major TODO items remaining:

* Looks like it would be optimal to have a common kernel-headers package
  which would contain common headers for all arches without unmerged patches.

* Various remaining kludges (stripping and sparc32/sparc64 stuff on sparc,
  for example).

* Generate the control file for individual files dynamically, so that we
  do not have that ridiculous master control file.
