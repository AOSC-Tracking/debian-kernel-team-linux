These patches are the lone remaining efika patches that got not yet merged.

They are comprised of various groups :

  1) the bestcomm patches. They are of upstream quality, not yet commited
  because the drivers using them are not yet fully ready, and so nothing in
  mainline does use them :

	0004-powerpc-BestComm-core-support-for-Freescale-MPC5200.patch
	0005-powerpc-BestcComm-ATA-task-support.patch
	0006-powerpc-BestcComm-FEC-task-support.patch
	0007-powerpc-BestcComm-GenBD-task-support.patch
	0011-powerpc-BestComm-move-the-EXPORT_SYMBOL-and-use-th.patch
	0012-powerpc-BestComm-ATA-task-move-the-EXPORT_SYMBOL-a.patch
	0013-powerpc-BestComm-FEC-task-move-the-EXPORT_SYMBOL-a.patch
	0014-powerpc-BestComm-GenBD-task-move-the-EXPORT_SYMBOL.patch
	0015-powerpc-BestComm-Replace-global-variable-bcom-by-b.patch
	0016-powerpc-Make-the-BestComm-driver-a-standard-of_plat.patch
	0017-powerpc-Fix-typo-in-BestComm-ATA-task-support-code.patch
	0018-powerpc-BestComm-ATA-task-microcode-insert-copyri.patch
	0019-powerpc-BestComm-FEC-task-microcode-insert-copyri.patch
	0020-powerpc-BestComm-GenBD-task-microcode-insert-copy.patch
	0021-powerpc-Fix-errors-in-bcom-bcom_eng-renaming.patch

  2) selects the CONFIG_PPC_RHEAP thingy, and export the symbols which are
  used by the above bestcom code, so the bestcom drivers can be built modular :

	0001-powerpc-exports-rheap-symbol-to-modules.patch
	0002-powerpc-Changes-the-config-mechanism-for-rheap.patch
	0010-powerpc-In-rheap.c-move-the-EXPORT_SYMBOL-and-use.patch

  3) the reworked ethernet driver for MPC5200 used in the Efika. This one is a
  cleaned up and reworked thingy, which may be upstream quality, but was not
  yet reviewed by the mpc5200 porter for lack of time :

	0008-drivers-net-Add-support-for-Freescale-MPC5200-SoC-i.patch

  4) the mpc5200 sound driver. Not yet cleaned up for upstream submission, as
  it has less priority than the above code :

	0009-sound-Add-support-for-Freescale-MPC5200-AC97-interf.patch

  5) the mpc5200 rtc driver. 

	11675_mpc5200_rtc_driver.patch

  6) suspendi/resume patch for the mpc52xx pata driver.

	0082-powerpc-pata_mpc52xx-suspend.patch

  7) assorted minor bug fixes, may be upstream already or soon will be.

	0003-powerpc-ppc32-Update-mpc52xx_psc-structure-with-B-r.patch
	0081-mpc52xx-correct-calculation-of-FEC-RX-errors.patch
	11303_Fix_mpc52xx_uart_of_assign_to_use_correct_index.patch
	11861_mpc52xx_sparse_fixes.patch
	12626_mpx5200_uart_drop_port_lock_across_tty_flip_buffer_call.patch

So, these patches, except for the sound/rtc drivers, should all be of upstream
quality, and the only thing stopping their mainline inclusion is the lack of
time of the mpc5200 porter. Sylvain mentioned that in the worst case, he
should have time during the christmas vacations to clean these patches up, and
push them into mainline.

None of these patches affect non-powerpc code, and furthermore, they are
mpc5200 specific, and will not affect other powerpc cpus.

They do indeed add new symbols, in order to build the bestcomm drivers
modular, but these symbols are not used on anything except these patches.
Still it is apparently an abi breakage, and i recomend including them with an
abi-breaking 2.6.22-4, or if an urgent non-abi breaking upload is needed to
just disable those patches instead of reversing this commit.
