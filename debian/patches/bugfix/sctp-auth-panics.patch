    sctp: fix potential panics in the SCTP-AUTH API.
    
    All of the SCTP-AUTH socket options could cause a panic
    if the extension is disabled and the API is envoked.
    
    Additionally, there were some additional assumptions that
    certain pointers would always be valid which may not
    always be the case.
    
    This patch hardens the API and address all of the crash
    scenarios.
