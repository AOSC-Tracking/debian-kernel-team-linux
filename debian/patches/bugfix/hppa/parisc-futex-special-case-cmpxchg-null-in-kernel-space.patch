commit f9e77acd4060fefbb60a351cdb8d30fca27fe194
Author: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

    futex: runtime enable pi and robust functionality
 

which was backported to stable based on mainline Commit
a0c1e9073ef7428a14309cba010633a6cd6719ea added code to futex.c
to detect whether futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic was implemented at run
time:

+       curval = cmpxchg_futex_value_locked(NULL, 0, 0);
+       if (curval == -EFAULT)
+               futex_cmpxchg_enabled = 1;

This is bogus on parisc, since page zero in kernel virtual space is the
gateway page for syscall entry, and should not be read from the kernel.
(That, and we really don't like the kernel faulting on its own address
 space...)
