On m68k, I/O macros like inb() outw() etc. are only defined to
something useful if CONFIG_ISA is set; dummies are in place if
not, but four macros were missing from the !CONFIG_ISA case.
Adding these makes some drivers, such as speakup, compile again.
The patch was made against Debianâ€™s linux-2.6_2.6.32-24, but
applies cleanly on linux-m68k master.
