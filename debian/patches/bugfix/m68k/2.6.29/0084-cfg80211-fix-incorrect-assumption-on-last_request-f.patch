Subject: [PATCH 84/90] cfg80211: fix incorrect assumption on last_request for 11d

upstream commit: cc0b6fe88e99096868bdbacbf486c97299533b5a

The incorrect assumption is the last regulatory request
(last_request) is always a country IE when processing
country IEs. Although this is true 99% of the time the
first time this happens this could not be true.

This fixes an oops in the branch check for the last_request
when accessing drv_last_ie. The access was done under the
assumption the struct won't be null.

Note to stable: to port to 29 replace as follows, only 29 has
country IE code:

s|NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_COUNTRY_IE|REGDOM_SET_BY_COUNTRY_IE
