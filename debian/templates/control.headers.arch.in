Description: Virtual package that depends on all @version@ kernel headers for @arch@
 This package provides common kernel header files for version @version@ on
 @arch@, used to build out-of-tree kernel modules and the like.  It is mainly
 useful for module packages that want to build a module for all flavors of
 an architecture, without having to manually list each flavor in its control
 file.  If you don't know what any of this means, you probably don't need this.
