Description: Common architecture-specific header files for Linux kernel @version@
 This package provides the (sub)architecture-specific common kernel header files
 for Linux kernel version @version@, generally used for building out-of-tree
 kernel modules. To obtain a complete set of headers you also need to install
 the linux-headers-@version@-@abiname@-(flavour) package, matching the
 flavour of the kernel you intend the build for. To obtain such a set for the
 currently running kernel it is sufficient to run a command

 apt-get install linux-headers-@version@-@abiname@-$(uname -r)
 .
 and it will be unpacked in /usr/src/linux-headers-@version@-@abiname@-(flavour).

Depends: TODO
Description: Virtual package that depends on all @version@ kernel headers for @arch@
 This package provides common kernel header files for version @version@ on
 @arch@, used to build out-of-tree kernel modules and the like.  It is mainly
 useful for module packages that want to build a module for all flavors of
 an architecture, without having to manually list each flavor in its control
 file.  If you don't know what any of this means, you probably don't need this.
