Description: Linux kernel source for version @version@ with Debian patches
 This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel version 2.6.11.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then
 it is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package,
 which has been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image
 packages.

Section: devel
Priority: optional
Depends: bzip2, ${kpatch:Depends}
Suggests: linux-source-@version@
Description: Debian patches to version @version@ of the Linux kernel
 This package includes the patches used to produce the prepackaged
 linux-source-@version@ package, as well as architecture-specific
 patches. Note that these patches do NOT apply against a pristine
 Linux @version@ kernel but only against the kernel tarball
 linux-source-@version@_@version@.orig.tar.gz from the Debian archive.

Description: Linux kernel source tree for building Debian kernel images
 This meta package is used as a build dependency of Debian
 linux-image packages to prevent a version discrepancy between
 the linux-image and corresponding linux-sources packages in the
 fast-moving unstable archive. The package's dependency relations
 are structured so that a linux-image package's build
 dependencies can always be satisfied, even if the linux-source
 package that had been used to compile the image has been
 superseeded by a newer Debian revision since the last build.
 .
 The package provides a list of virtual packages, corresponding to
 Debian revisions of a linux-source package. The Debian
 linux-patch contains the information needed to roll back the
 current linux-source to any of the revisions identified by the
 provided virtual packages. Therefore, the linux-tree package
 ensures the availability of the Linux kernel source tree corresponding
 to each of the virtual packages listed.
 .
 The package serves no purpose outside of the Debian build and
 archive infrastructure.
