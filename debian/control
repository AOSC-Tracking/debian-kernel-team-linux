Description: Linux kernel source for version 2.6.11 with Debian patches
 This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel version 2.6.11.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then
 it is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package,
 which has been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image
 packages.

Description: Linux kernel specific documentation for version 2.6.11
 This package provides the various README files in the 2.6.11 kernel
 Documentation/ subdirectory: these typically contain kernel-specific
 installation notes for some drivers for example. See
 /usr/share/doc/linux-doc-2.6.11/Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what
 is contained in each file.

Suggests: linux-source-2.6.11
Description: Debian patches to version 2.6.11 of the Linux kernel
 This package includes the patches used to produce the prepackaged
 linux-source-2.6.11 package. Note that these patches do NOT apply
 against a pristine Linux 2.6.11 kernel but only against
 linux-source-2.6.11_2.6.11.orig.tar.gz from the Debian archive.

Description: Linux kernel source tree for building Debian kernel images
 This meta package is used as a build dependency of Debian
 linux-image packages to prevent a version discrepancy between
 the linux-image and corresponding linux-sources packages in the
 fast-moving unstable archive. The package's dependency relations
 are structured so that a linux-image package's build
 dependencies can always be satisfied, even if the linux-source
 package that had been used to compile the image has been
 superseeded by a newer Debian revision since the last build.
 .
 The package provides a list of virtual packages, corresponding to
 Debian revisions of a linux-source package. The Debian
 linux-patch contains the information needed to roll back the
 current linux-source to any of the revisions identified by the
 provided virtual packages. Therefore, the linux-tree package
 ensures the availability of the Linux kernel source tree corresponding
 to each of the virtual packages listed.
 .
 The package serves no purpose outside of the Debian build and
 archive infrastructure.

Package: linux-scripts-2.6.11-1
Architecture: any
Section: devel
Priority: optional
Depends: coreutils | fileutils (>= 4.0)
Description: Architecture-specific header files for Linux kernel 2.6.11
 This package provides the architecture-specific support files for Linux
 kernel version 2.6.11, generally used for building out-of-tree
 kernel modules. It mainly contains the binaries from the script/ kernel
 directory, as well as other architecture-dependent files such as
 asm-offsets.s.
