linux-2.6 (2.6.12-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  "git rocks"

    - new resource limits for the audio community
    - Multipath device mapper
    - Intel HD Audio alsa driver
    - fixes + arch updates..

  * Dropped the following patches:
    - patch-2.6.11.*.patch (merged)
    - powerpc-ppc64-ibmvscsi.patch (Christoph didn't like it, and it failed
      to build anyways) (Sven Luther)
    - doc-post_halloween.patch (unless someone can come up w/ a valid
      reason for carrying around rapidly bitrotting documentation...)
      (Andres Salomon)
    - sparc32-hypersparc-srmmu.patch (dropped until sparc32 is working
      again, and we can figure out whether it's necessary)
    - fix-alpha-ext3-oops.patch (workaround for compiler bug, dropping
      until further alpha testing is done)
    - x86-i486_emu.patch (buggy and insecure 80486 instruction emulation
      for 80386; we're no longer supporting this) (closes: #250468)
    - amd64-outs.patch (according to
      http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0502.3/1095.html, this
      is unnecessary for us) (Andres Salomon)

  * Premiere of the common-source kernel package
    (Jurij Smakov, Andres Salomon)
    - build all architectures out of kernel source package
    - rename source and binary packages
    - create a common config for different architectures, and management
      tools to allow for easier modification of config options

  * Add 2.6.12.1 (Maximilian Attems)
    - Clean up subthread exec (CAN-2005-1913)
    - ia64 ptrace + sigrestore_context (CAN-2005-1761)

  * Add 2.6.12.2 (Frederik SchÃ¼ler)
    - Fix two socket hashing bugs.
    -  ACPI: Make sure we call acpi_register_gsi() even for default PCI
       interrupt assignment
    - Add "memory" clobbers to the x86 inline asm of strncmp and friends
    - e1000: fix spinlock bug
    - fix remap_pte_range BUG
    - Fix typo in drivers/pci/pci-driver.c

  * Add 2.6.12.3 (Joshua Kwan)
    - Fix semaphore handling in __unregister_chrdev
    - Fix TT mode in UML.
    - Check for a null return in tty_ldisc_ref.
    - v4l: cx88 hue offset fix
    - Fix 8139cp breakage that occurs with tpm driver.
    - Fix the 6pack driver in SMP environments.
    - Switch to spinlocks in the shaper driver.
    - ppc32: stop misusing NTP's time_offset value
    - netfilter: go back to dropping conntrack references manually
    - ACPI: don't accept 0 as a PCI IRQ.

  * Renamed resulting binary packages for alpha. (Norbert Tretkowski)
    - kernel-image-x.y.z-generic -> linux-image-x.y.z-alpha-generic
    - kernel-image-x.y.z-smp     -> linux-image-x.y.z-alpha-smp
    - This change was postponed after the sarge release. (closes: #260003)

  * Enable CONFIG_SCSI_INITIO. (Maximilian Attems) (closes: #318121)

  * Added powerpc-mkvmlinuz-support patch, as this is really tied to the
    kernel version. kernel-package will be teached to make use of this, but it
    needs some cleanup and tidying yet. (Sven Luther)

  * Disabled software suspend on powerpc-smp, as the smp code in software
    suspend is amd64/i386 only. (Sven Luther)
