  * Renamed resulting binary packages for alpha. (Norbert Tretkowski)
    - kernel-image-x.y.z-generic -> linux-image-x.y.z-alpha-generic
    - kernel-image-x.y.z-smp     -> linux-image-x.y.z-alpha-smp

  * Enable CONFIG_SCSI_INITIO. (Maximilian Attems) closes: #318121

  * Added powerpc-mkvmlinuz-support patch, as this is really tied to the
    kernel version. kernel-package will be teached to make use of this, but it
    needs some cleanup and tidying yet. (Sven Luther)

  * Removed the ibmvscsi patch, as Christoph doesn't like it, and it failed to
    build anyway. (Sven Luther)

  * Disabled software suspend on powerpc-smp, as the smp code in software
    suspend is amd64/i386 only. (Sven Luther)
