Description: Header files for Linux kernel @version@ on uniprocessor 32-bit SPARC
 This package provides kernel header files for version @version@ on the 32-bit 
 SPARC architecture, used to build out-of-tree kernel modules. If you have
 more than one processor, you want the kernel-headers-@version@-@abiname@-sparc64-smp
 package.

Description: Linux kernel binary image for UltraSPARC (sparc32) systems
 This package contains the Linux kernel image, the System.map file,
 and the modules built by the packager.  It also contains scripts that
 try to ensure that the system is not left in a unbootable state
 after an update.
 .
 Kernel image packages are generally produced using kernel-package,
 and it is suggested that you install that package if you wish to
 create a custom kernel from the sources.
 .
 NOTE: This kernel is strictly for 32-bit Super/HyperSPARC (sun4m) class
 systems. If you do not have a SuperSPARC or HyperSPARC CPU, then most likely
 you want the sparc64 image. See kernel-image-@version@-@abiname@-sparc64.

 instead.

 See kernel-image-@version@-@abiname@-sparc32. Also, this kernel is 
 specifically for SMP (multiple processors) systems. If you do not have more
 than one CPU, then choose the non-SMP kernel image.
